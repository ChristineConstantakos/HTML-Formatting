        <h1>Formatting Demo Page</h1>

        <p>This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags
            covered in this lesson.
        </p>

        <h2>Bold and Strong</h2>

        <b>This is bold text</b>

        <p>The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold 
            tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as
            more important.  It is also easier for screen readers
            to read for the visually disabled.</p>
            <strong>This is what strgon text looks like</strong>
            
            <h2>Italic an Emphasis</h2>
            <i>This text is italics</i>
            <p>The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as
                the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks
                the enclosed text as more important.  It is also 
                easier for screen readers to read.</p>

                <em>This is what emphasized text looks like.</em>

                <h2>Inserted and Deleted</h2>
                <p>Inserted text looks like this:<ins>This is 
                    inserted.</ins>
                </p>
                <p>Deleted text looks like this:<del>This is 
                    deleted</del>
                </p>
                <h2>Marked</h2>
